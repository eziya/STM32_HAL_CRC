# STM32_HAL_CRC

I've implemented test code to check flash integrity with CRC checksum<br>
It's simple with IAR workbench as it supports CRC checksum feature at Linker menu.<br>
But it could be tricky with Truestudio as it doesn't support CRC checksum.<br>
So. I used SRecord(http://srecord.sourceforge.net/) to add CRC checksum to the binary file.<br>

[Checkpoint]
1) Build project and output format is binary
<br>![pic1](./pic1.png)<br>
2) SRecord will calculate CRC from 0x8000000 to 0x8008FFB and place checksum at 0x8008FFC<br>
Input file: STM32F4_HAL_CRC.bin, Output file with CRC: STM32F4_HAL_CRC_X.bin<br>
```
c:\SREC\srec_cat.exe STM32F4_HAL_CRC.bin -binary 
-crop 0x0000 0x8FFC -fill 0xFF 0x0000 0x8FFC
-stm32-l-e 0x8FFC 
-o STM32F4_HAL_CRC_X.bin -binary
```
3) Checksum is added to the binary like below

4) Upload STM32_HAL_X.bin and run
5) HAL_CRC_Calculate API will calculate CRC from 0x8000000 to 0x8008FFB
```
crc = HAL_CRC_Calculate(&hcrc, (uint32_t*)ROM_START, (uint32_t)ROM_LEN_WORD);
checksum = *(uint32_t*)CHECKSUM;
```

6) If the calculated value is matched with written checksum at 0x8008FFC, LED blinks fast, if not LED blinks slowly.
```
HAL_GPIO_TogglePin(GPIOD, GPIO_PIN_15);
if(crc == checksum)
{
	HAL_Delay(100);
}
else
{
	HAL_Delay(1000);
}
```
